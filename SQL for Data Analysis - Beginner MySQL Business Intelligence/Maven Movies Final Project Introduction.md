# Introducing the Final Course Project

### The Situation

My business partner and I were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars,
so he has lots of questions for me about my business and the rental business in general. His off seems very generous, so I'm going to entertain his questions.


### The Objective
Leverage my SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer my potential Acquirer's questions.


### The Letter
Dear Maven Movies Management, <br>

I am excited about the potential acquisition and learning more about your rental business. Please bear with me as I am new to the industry. I have a number of questions for
you. Asssuming you can answer them all, and that there are no major surprises, we should be able to move forward with the purchase. <br>

Best,
Martin Moneybags
