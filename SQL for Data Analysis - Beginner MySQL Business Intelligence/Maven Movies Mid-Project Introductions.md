# Introducing the Mid Course Project

### The Situation
<hr>

The company's insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company's underwriters need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy.

<br>

### The Objective
<hr>

Leverage my SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer the underwriters' questions.

<br>

### The Letter
<hr>

Dear Maven Movies Management, <br>

In our review of your policy renewal application, we have realized that your business information has not been updated in a number of years. In order to accurate;y assess the
risk and approve your policy renewal, we all need you to provide all of the following information. <br>

Sincerely, <br>
Joe Bangles, Lead Underwriter
